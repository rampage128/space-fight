Julius - Came up with the original concept and posted a low-poly version on OpenGameArt.org here: http://opengameart.org/content/future-fighterjet

Origin - Rebuilt the model for proper normalmap baking, unwrapped the model and took care of the basic texture.

H-Hour - Came in at the end and added a bit of color and a few final touches to the texture.
